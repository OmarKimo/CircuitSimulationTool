# CircuitSimulationTool

## A circuit simulation tool designed to solve circuits

## The user inputs the circuit details to the simulation and it calculates the *current*, *voltage*, or *power* depending on the user's needs

### To know how the program works you can read the [Requirements](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CircuitSimulationTool/tree/master/Circuits%20Project%20Details.pdf) file

### You can run this game by opening [Project.sln](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CircuitSimulationTool/tree/master/Project.sln) in Visual Studio besides [installing Eigen Library](https://phylogeny.uconn.edu/tutorial-v2/part-1-ide-project-v2/setting-up-the-eigen-library-v2/)
